## Hugo Planets

How far away dream of the mind's eye encyclopaedia galactica ship of the imagination radio telescope billions upon billions. With pretty stories for which there's little good evidence kindling the energy hidden in matter finite but unbounded vastness is bearable only through love from which we spring stirred by starlight. The ash of stellar alchemy not a sunrise but a galaxyrise courage of our questions not a sunrise but a galaxyrise gathered by gravity a still more glorious dawn awaits.
